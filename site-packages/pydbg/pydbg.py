    Extending from the core this class defines a more usable debugger objects implementing a number of features such as:

        - Register manipulation.
        - Soft (INT 3) breakpoints.
        - Memory breakpoints (page permissions).
        - Hardware breakpoints.
        - Exception / event handling call backs.
        - Pydasm (libdasm) disassembly wrapper.
        - Process memory snapshotting and restoring.
        - Endian manipulation routines.
        - Debugger hiding.
        - Function resolution.
        - "Intelligent" memory derefencing.
        - Stack/SEH unwinding.

        Sets a hardware breakpoint at the designated address. Register an EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP callback handler to
        catch hardware breakpoint events. Setting hardware breakpoints requires the internal h_thread handle be set.
        This means that you can not set one outside the context of an debug event handler. If you want to set a hardware
        breakpoint as soon as you attach to or load a process, do so in the first chance breakpoint handler.

        For more information regarding the Intel x86 debug registers and hardware breakpoints see::

            Section 15.2

        Alternatively, you can register a custom handler to handle hits on the specific hw breakpoint slot.

        "Intelligently" discover data behind an address. The address is dereferenced and explored in search of an ASCII
        or Unicode string. In the absense of a string the printable characters are returned with non-printables
        represented as dots (.). The location of the discovered data is returned as well as either "heap", "stack" or
        the name of the module it lies in (global data).
